# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
Boy oh Boy, week 0 has been intense! I watched the Week 0 live stream where I learned about working with customers to understand their needs and work towards a cloud strategy. It was emphasized that we shouldn't be afraid to ask "dumb" questions as it could lead to some "aha" moments. The session gave me an insightful introduction to cloud computing, and it made me realize that there's a lot more to learn. 


I'm excited to see what the next few weeks have in store for me.








Extra Credit: 
While attending the Free AWS Cloud Bootcamp, I made the decision to simultaneously work towards obtaining my Solution Architect Associate Certification and completing the AWS Resume Challenge, which I purchased in June 2022. I wanted to gain additional experience and stand out in the bootcamp, with the ultimate goal of being a part of the coveted "red squad!!". I consider myself fortunate to have heard about the Free AWS Cloud Bootcamp, as it has motivated me to take my journey as a cloud professional more seriously.

During week 0 of the resume challenge, I wrote my resume in HTML and CSS, and purchased a domain on Route 53 to host my static website on S3. This was a challenging yet fulfilling experience that allowed me to showcase my skills and knowledge of AWS technologies. 
Here's my hosted resume on S3: http://corvettasmith.com/, Cloudfront is enabled, but my site in still showing as "unsecured". I will continue to work on figuring out where I missteped.
