# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture









Extra Credit: 
While attending the Free AWS Cloud Bootcamp, I made the decision to simultaneously work towards obtaining my Solution Architect Associate Certification and completing the AWS Resume Challenge, which I purchased in June 2022. I wanted to gain additional experience and stand out in the bootcamp, with the ultimate goal of being a part of the coveted "red squad!!". I consider myself fortunate to have heard about the Free AWS Cloud Bootcamp, as it has motivated me to take my journey as a cloud professional more seriously.

During week 0 of the resume challenge, I wrote my resume in HTML and CSS, and purchased a domain on Route 53 to host my static website on S3. This was a challenging yet fulfilling experience that allowed me to showcase my skills and knowledge of AWS technologies. 
Here's my hosted resume on S3: http://corvettasmith.com/
